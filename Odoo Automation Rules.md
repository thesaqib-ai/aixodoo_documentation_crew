To comprehensively meet the specified business requirements using Odoo Studio's automation capabilities, we will leverage automation rules and triggers at various stages of the sales order system. This approach will ensure efficiency and accuracy in operations by automating key business processes as outlined below:

1. **Trigger upon Updating Specific Fields:**
   - **Invoice Automation:**
     - Trigger: When the "Payment Status" field is set to "Paid".
     - Action: Automatically send a "Thank You" email to the customer and update the "Customer Payment History".
   - **Quotation Automation:**
     - Trigger: When the "Quotation Status" field is updated to "Approved".
     - Action: Automatically generate a Sales Order Confirmation PDF and send it to the client for final review.

2. **Time-Based Automation:**
   - **Sales Order Confirmation:**
     - Trigger: 7 days after a sales order confirmation without a recorded payment.
     - Action: Automatically send a payment reminder email to the customer and notify the sales team.
   - **Delivery Note:**
     - Trigger: 3 days before the scheduled dispatch date.
     - Action: Send a reminder to the warehouse team to prepare the goods for shipment.

3. **External Event Triggers:**
   - **Invoice Automation:**
     - Trigger: Upon receiving a payment confirmation from the bank.
     - Action: Automatically mark the invoice as paid and generate a receipt PDF for record-keeping.
   - **Quotation Request:**
     - Trigger: When a client submits a request for a new quotation through the external portal.
     - Action: Automatically create a draft quotation in the system and assign it to the appropriate sales representative for processing.

4. **User Action Triggers:**
   - **Delivery Note Creation:**
     - Trigger: When the sales order is marked as "Ready for Delivery".
     - Action: Automatically generate a delivery note PDF and queue it for printing and dispatch.

5. **Conditional Logic Automation:**
   - **Invoice & Quotation:**
     - Implement conditional logic to apply specific terms and conditions based on client categorization (e.g., VIP clients receive extended payment terms).
     - Utilize the conditions to dynamically adjust the content of the "Terms and Conditions" section in the PDF reports.

**Outcome:**
By implementing these automation rules and triggers in Odoo Studio, the organization will significantly reduce manual intervention, enhance real-time responsiveness, and maintain seamless workflow across different stages of the sales order process. The strategic use of these automated processes will directly contribute to improved productivity, accuracy, and customer satisfaction, aligning with the business objectives of operational excellence and efficiency.
