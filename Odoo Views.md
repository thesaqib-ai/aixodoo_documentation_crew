**Report on Odoo Studio's Views Required for Implementation**

In analyzing the business requirements report, I have identified the specific Odoo Studio views that will be needed for the implementation of the sales order system. Here is a detailed report outlining the views across the four categories: general, multiple records, timeline, and reporting.

1. **General Views:**
   - **Form View for Sales Order Model:** This view will capture detailed sales order information, including custom fields like customer priority and delivery deadlines. It will need to facilitate the input and review of order details by users.
   - **Form View for Notification Model:** To manage notifications, this view will allow users to configure and view alerts related to sales order stages.
   - **Form View for Approval Workflow Model:** This view will support the setup and management of automated approval processes, particularly for large orders exceeding $10,000.
   - **Form View for Dashboard Model:** A view providing a detailed interface for monitoring order tracking, sales performance and prioritizing high-priority orders.

2. **Multiple Records Views:**
   - **List View for Sales Orders:** To display all sales orders with critical fields like order status, deadline, and customer priority. This view will facilitate quick filtering and sorting of sales orders.
   - **List View for Notifications:** A view showing all active notifications, helping users to manage and track notification status.
   - **List View for Approvals:** To show pending and completed approval requests, allowing easy tracking of approval workflows.
   - **Kanban View for Sales Orders:** A visual representation of order stages, giving a quick overview of order progress and status.

3. **Timeline Views:**
   - **Activities View for Sales Orders:** To showcase key activities and timelines related to each sales order, ensuring stakeholders can track progress and deadlines.
   - **Calendar View for Delivery Deadlines:** A timeline view focused on delivery deadlines, allowing sales teams to monitor and manage order fulfillment schedules effectively.

4. **Reporting Views:**
   - **Graph View for Sales Performance:** Visualization of sales performance metrics, allowing management to assess KPIs and trends over time.
   - **Pivot Table View for Financial Reports:** To produce detailed financial reports by region and sales representative, enabling data-driven decisions.
   - **Dashboard View with KPI Visualization:** A comprehensive dashboard that provides a user-friendly interface for tracking sales performance, high-priority orders, and other key metrics.
   - **Cohort View for Order Tracking:** To analyze order completion rates and customer satisfaction over specific periods.

**Integration Points:**
- **Inventory & Accounting Integration Views:** These will ensure seamless data sharing and operations between sales, inventory, and accounting functions. Views will facilitate the management of stock reservations and invoicing processes.

**Additional Considerations:**
- **Role-Based Access Control in Views:** Implementing role-based access within views to ensure data security and compliance, allowing different access levels for managers and staff.
- **Exportable Reports from Views:** Capability to export data from list and pivot table views into PDF and Excel formats for sharing across teams.

By utilizing these Odoo Studio views, the implementation will achieve a streamlined and efficient sales order management process, fully aligned with the specified business requirements.
